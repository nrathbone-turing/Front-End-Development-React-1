# Overview

You are a junior developer working on a team responsible for creating dynamic web applications. Your task is to create a simple application using React and npm that displays a dynamic clock. The clock will show the current date and time. This lab will help you understand how to structure a React project and manage dependencies using npm.

In this lab, you will:

Set up a React project using Vite.
Use JSX to define UI components.
Incorporate a package from npm to enhance your project.
Explore the React project structure and best practices.


# Scenario

Your team is developing a new productivity dashboard, and one of the widgets is a colorful digital clock that displays the current date and time. The clock should:

1. Display the current date and time in a readable format.
2. Use the date-fns package to handle date formatting.

Your task is to build this clock feature using React and npm, ensuring it dynamically displays and is visually appealing.

## Task 1: Define Project Needs and Goals

**Review React Basics:** Read through the official React documentation to understand the structure of a React project and how JSX works.
**Create React Application:** Install the project using Vite:
```
npm create vite@latest color-clock --template react
```
- Type 'y' if prompted to install create-vite
- Select 'React' as the framework
- Select 'JavaScript' as the variant

**Install Dependencies:** Navigate to your project directory:
```
cd color-clock
```
- Install packages:
```
npm install
```
- Install date-fns for date formatting:
```
npm install date-fns@2.30.0
```

## Task 2: Design and Develop the Code

### Step 1: Set Up the Project Structure

1. Look through the files generated by Vite. Your src folder should contain `main.jsx` and `App.jsx` along with a few other files.
2. Your code will go in `App.jsx`.

### Step 2: Build the App Component

**Your task:** Add the logic to render the current time using date-fns.

1. In `App.jsx`, remove the current JSX and add a p tag that renders a placeholder for the current time.
2. Use the `date-fns` package to format the current date and time. Add the logic to the `<p>` tag. Be sure to remember to put JavaScript logic in curly braces in JSX, i.e. `<p>{format( // your format here )}</p>`.

**Hint:** Use the `format` function from `date-fns`. Look at the packageâ€™s documentation to figure out how to import and use it. The rubric isn't looking for a specific order or format, as long as the date and time are both shown.

### Step 3: Run the Application

Use `npm run dev` to run your application in the terminal. Ensure the date and time are rendered to the page. Use DevTools to check for errors in the console and debug, if needed.

### Step 4: Style Your Application

Add a CSS file to style your clock.

**Challenge:** Make your clock visually appealing. Think about colors, fonts, and layout. Research CSS best practices for ideas. *The rubric is looking for at least 1 additional color implemented beyond black and white.*



## Task 3: Test and Refine

### Step 1: Run the Project

Run your application:
`npm run dev`

### Step 2: Debug the Application

Use browser developer tools to inspect the DOM and verify that the clock displays the current date and time correctly.

**Hint:** If you encounter any errors, try searching for solutions online or asking your peers for help.

## Task 4: Document and Maintain

### Use Version Control:

- Initialize a Git repository for your project.
- Commit your changes regularly.

**Challenge:** Write meaningful commit messages that describe the changes you made.

### Document Your Code:
- Add comments to explain your JSX and project structure.

**Hint:** Think about what someone new to your project would need to know to understand your code.
